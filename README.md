## Introduction

Welcome to your new Laravel project! This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring your Laravel application. By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Laravel environment ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **PHP** (version 7.3 or higher)
- **Composer**
- **MySQL** or your preferred database
- **Git**

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rifat32/hrm
cd hrm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install PHP dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```



### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and update the configuration:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and update the following variables with your database and application details:

```env
APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:generated-app-key
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### 4. Generate Application Key

```

### 5. Project data setup

Run the migrations to create the database tables:

```sh
php artisan setup
```



### 7. Serve the Application

Start the local development server:

```sh

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
